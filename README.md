# Owlbot app
App that uses Owlbot API to define words. 

This is mainly a practise project to learn about Flutter and Dart. I copied some of the looks from [another owlbot app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.bergerapps.owlbot).

## Possible future stuff to do
- widget and integration testing
- light/dark mode

## Super secret stuff! (not really...)
If word definition has image, try touching it! It opens it in the browser.
